# Sms-Spam-Detection
SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
It demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and prediction using Python.

##  Project Overview
Spam messages are a common problem in communication systems. This project leverages **machine learning algorithms** to detect and filter out spam messages effectively.  
It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier**, which has proven to be highly effective for text classification tasks.

##  Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw text data  
- Converted text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
- Trained multiple ML models and selected the best performing one  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Integrated a simple **Flask web app (`app.py`)** for real-time spam detection
